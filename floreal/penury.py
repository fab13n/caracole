    some resources, and that resource exists in insufficient quantity to
    satisfy the total demand, a way must be found to allocate existing resources

    This heuristic finds a ceiling, a maximal authorized quantity of
    resources allowed per consumer. Those who asked less than the
    ceiling will receive what they asked for, others will receive the
    ceiling quantity. resources are attributed by integral values, so
    there might be some resources left, although less than 1unit per
    unsatisfied consumer. The couple of remaining resource units beyond
    the ceiling are attributed to the consumers who asked for the most
    resources, i.e. presumably the most unsatisfied ones.
